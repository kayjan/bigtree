# 🌵 Binary Tree

For **Binary Tree** implementation, there are 3 main components.
Binary Node inherits from Node, so the components in Tree implementation are also available in Binary Tree.

## [**🌿 Node**](../bigtree/node/binarynode.md)
- ``BinaryNode``, Node with binary tree rules

## [**🎄 Binary Tree**](../bigtree/binarytree/binarytree.md)
- ``BinaryTree``, wrapper around ``BinaryNode``, providing high-level APIs to build, iterate, query, and export the entire tree structure

## [**✨ Constructing Binary Tree**](../bigtree/binarytree/construct.md)
- From *list*, using flattened list structure

## [**➰ Traversing Binary Tree**](../bigtree/utils/iterators.md)
- In-Order Traversal
