## Tree Construct Methods

Construct Tree from list, dictionary, and pandas DataFrame.

To decide which method to use, consider your data type and data values.

| Construct tree from    | Using full path       | Using parent-child relation       | Using notation      | Add node attributes                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| String                 | ` str_to_tree`        | NA                                | ` newick_to_tree`   | No (for ` str_to_tree `)<br>Yes (for  `newick_to_tree`)   |
| List                   | ` list_to_tree`       | ` list_to_tree_by_relation`       | NA                  | No                                                        |
| Dictionary             | ` dict_to_tree`       | ` nested_dict_to_tree`            | NA                  | Yes                                                       |
| DataFrame              | `dataframe_to_tree`   | `dataframe_to_tree_by_relation`   | NA                  | Yes                                                       |

## Tree Add Attributes Methods

To add attributes to an existing tree,

| Add attributes from         | Using full path                  | Using node name                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| String                      | ` add_path_to_tree`              | NA                                |
| Dictionary                  | ` add_dict_to_tree_by_path`      | ` add_dict_to_tree_by_name`       |
| DataFrame                   | ` add_dataframe_to_tree_by_path` | ` add_dataframe_to_tree_by_name ` |

!!! note

    If attributes are added to existing tree using **full path**, paths that previously did not exist will be added.<br>
    If attributes are added to existing tree using **node name**, names that previously did not exist will not be created.

These functions are not standalone functions.
Under the hood, they have the following dependency,
