# üìù Modify

There are two types of modification available

1. **Non-replacing scenario**: Shift or copy nodes within same tree or between two trees using `from_paths` (list of paths) and `to_paths` (list of paths).
2. **Replacing scenario**: Shift or copy nodes within same tree or between two trees *while replacing the to-node* using `from_paths` (list of paths) and `to_paths` (list of paths).


## Available Configurations for Customization

In **non-replacing scenario**, there are several configurations available for customization.

| Configuration     | Description                                                                            | Default Value                                             |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `copy`            | Indicates whether it is to shift the nodes, or copy the nodes                          | False (nodes are shifted, not copied)                     |
| `to_tree`         | Indicates whether shifting/copying is within the same tree, or between different trees | None (nodes are shifted/copied within the same tree)      |
| `skippable`       | Skip shifting/copying of nodes if from_path cannot be found                            | False (from-node must be found)                           |
| `overriding`      | Override existing node if it exists                                                    | False (to-node must not exist)                            |
| `merge_attribute` | Merge attributes of existing node if it exists                                         | False (to-node must not exist, attributes are not merged) |
| `merge_children`  | Shift/copy children of from-node and remove intermediate parent node                   | False (children are not merged)                           |
| `merge_leaves`    | Shift/copy leaves of from-node and remove all intermediate nodes                       | False (leaves are not merged)                             |
| `delete_children` | Shift/copy node only and delete its children                                           | False (nodes are shifted/copied together with children)   |

In **replacing scenario**, all the configurations are also available except `overriding`, `merge_attribute`,
`merge_children`, and `merge_leaves` as it is doing a one-to-one replacement.
It is by default overriding, and there is nothing to merge.

!!! note

    `overriding` and `merge_attribute` cannot be simultaneously set to `True`. One deals with clashing nodes by
    overriding, another deals with it by merging attributes of both nodes.

!!! note

    `merge_children` and `merge_leaves` cannot be simultaneously set to `True`.

!!! note

    Error will always be thrown if multiple from-nodes are found, paths in `from_paths` must be unique.

## Tree Modification Permutations

There are several ways you can mix and match the tree modification methods.
If you know all the parameters to choose, feel free to use ``copy_or_shift_logic`` or ``replace_logic`` methods as they are the most customizable.
All other methods calls these 2 methods directly.

| Shift / Copy? | Same tree / Between two trees? | Replace destination node? | Method to use                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Shift         | Same tree                      | No                        | ``shift_nodes``                              |
| Copy          | Same tree                      | No                        | ``copy_nodes``                               |
| Copy          | Between two trees              | No                        | ``copy_nodes_from_tree_to_tree``             |
| Any           | Any                            | No                        | ``copy_or_shift_logic``                      |
| Shift         | Same tree                      | Yes                       | ``shift_and_replace_nodes``                  |
| Copy          | Between two trees              | Yes                       | ``copy_and_replace_nodes_from_tree_to_tree`` |
| Any           | Any                            | Yes                       | ``replace_logic``                            |

## Guideline

If you're still feeling lost over the parameters, here are some guiding questions to ask yourself.

- Do I want to retain the original node where they are?
  - Yes: Set `copy=True`
  - Default performs a shift instead of copy
- Am I unsure of what nodes I am going to copy/shift, they may or may not exist and this is perfectly fine?
  - Yes: Set `skippable=True`
  - Default throws error if origin node is not found
- The origin node (and its descendants) may clash with the destination node(s), how do I want to handle it?
  - Set `overriding=True` to overwrite origin node
  - Set `merge_attribute=True` to combine both nodes' attributes
  - Default throws error about the clash in node name
- I want to copy/shift everything under the node, but not the node itself
  - Set `merge_children=True` or `merge_leaves=True` to shift the children and leaf nodes respectively
  - Default shifts the node itself, and everything under it
- I want to copy/shift the node and only the node, and not everything under it
  - Yes: Set `delete_children=True`
  - Default shifts the node itself, and everything under it
- I want to copy/shift things from one tree to another tree
  - Specify `to_tree`
  - Default shifts nodes within the same tree

What about the permutations between the parameters?

- These parameters are standalone and do not produce any interaction effect
  - `copy`, `skippable`, `delete_children`
- These parameters have some interaction:
  - `overriding` and `merge_attribute` with `merge_children` and `merge_leaves`
  - `overriding` + `merge_children`: Behaves like `merge_children` when there is no clash in node name, otherwise behaves like `overriding`.
  Note that clashes will preserve origin node parent and destination nodes' children.
  - `overriding` + `merge_leaves`: Behaves like `merge_leaves` when there is no clash in node name, otherwise behaves like `overriding`.
  Note that clashes will preserve origin node parent and destination nodes' leaves.
  - `merge_attribute` + `merge_children`: Behaves like `merge_children` when there is no clash in node name, otherwise behaves like `merge_attribute`.
  Note that attributes will be merged for node and all descendants, and will preserve origin and destination nodes' children.
  - `merge_attribute` + `merge_leaves`: Behaves like `merge_leaves` when there is no clash in node name, otherwise behaves like `merge_attribute`.
  Note that attributes will be merged for node and all descendants, and will preserve origin nodes' children and destination nodes' leaves.
